| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x00  | [Backend, Pagination](./0x00-pagination/)                                                                                                               |**Backend Pagination** is a technique used to divide large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks, improving performance and user experience. It involves requesting a specific subset of data from the server based on parameters like page number or limit, instead of loading the entire dataset at once.|            
| 0x01  | [Backend, Caching](./0x01-caching/)                                                                                                                     |**Backend Caching** is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage (cache) to reduce load times and improve application performance. By serving data from the cache rather than querying the database repeatedly, backend caching helps reduce server load and latency. Common caching mechanisms include **in-memory caches** like **Redis** or **Memcached**.|
| 0x02  | [Backend i18n](./0x02-i18n/)                                                                                                                            |**Backend i18n (Internationalization)** is the process of designing and developing backend systems to support multiple languages and regional settings. It involves preparing data and content for translation, handling date/time formats, currencies, and ensuring that the backend can serve content based on the user's language or locale preferences. Libraries like **gettext** or frameworks with built-in i18n support help manage translations and regional configurations. |                                                                                                                                                                 | A **Backend Queuing System in JavaScript** manages asynchronous tasks by storing them in a queue (e.g., **RabbitMQ**, **Bull**) and processing them with workers, improving scalability and performance.|
| 0x03  | [Backend Queing Systems in JavaScript](./0x03-queuing_system_in_js/)                                                                                    | A **Backend Queuing System in JavaScript** manages asynchronous tasks by storing them in a queue (e.g., **RabbitMQ**, **Bull**) and processing them with workers, improving scalability and performance. |
